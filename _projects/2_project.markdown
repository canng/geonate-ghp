As an emerging new hallmark of cancer, RNA splicing defects have been found in many tumour types. We have previously identified a recurrent mutation in U1 snRNA causing aberrant RNA splicing in multiple tumour types and associated with specific clinical features. Follow-up studies revealed even more likely driver mutations in snRNAs in cancer. At the COmics Lab, we are now conducting comprehensive analysis of abnormal RNA splicing events in cancer and hope one day we can find a way to design therapeutics against them.
