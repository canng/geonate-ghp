title:  Manuele's first COCOS paper out
author: Petr Keil
---

Manuele has published his first [paper in Journal of Ecology](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2745.14288) presenting results of his [COCOS Marie Curie](https://petrkeil.github.io/funding/post/2022/01/10/COCOS.html) project in MOBI lab. The paper explores how grasslands (specifically, their biomass) resist extreme droughts, and how they recover if they get hit. Spoiler: It depends on biodiversity.

There is also a [lovely blog post](https://jecologyblog.com/2024/04/15/biodiversity-supports-grassland-resistance-and-recovery-under-extreme-drought/) explaining what are the main findings. Check it out!

Congratulations Manu!
