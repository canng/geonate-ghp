    Zican comes from Nanchang, Jiangxi, a city that sits on the southeast of China. She obtained her undergraduate degree from St. Lawrence University in the U.S. Although Zican is graduated with a major in biology, she has been interested in neuroinformatic since her junior year and would love to continue exploring this field in the COmics Lab. In her leisure time, Zican likes to read sci-fiction, hike, and play the drum (though she is totally terrible at it and most of the time is yielding complete noise). Zican is a dog person, and she has two dogs named Ali and Xiaobei.

    子灿来自中国江西南昌，她本科在美国圣劳伦斯大学就读。虽然子灿本科的专业是生物，但是她从大三开始就对神经信息产生了很大的兴趣并希望在COmics Lab中继续探索她的科研方向。子灿平时喜欢读科幻小说，旅行，偶尔有机会也会打架子鼓（但是她水平还不是很好，大多数时间在乱敲）。子灿很喜欢狗，她现在的两只狗分别是黑色雪纳瑞阿力和白色贵宾小贝。
